# Done  

**I. Research Chip-8 architecture**  
    [Wikipedia link](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CHIP-8)  
    [Technical reference](http://devernay.free.fr/hacks/chip8/C8TECH10.HTM)

    [Example of a working Emulator + ROMs](https://github.com/dmatlack/chip8)

**II. Set up project**  
    I'm using C, developing in VSCode  
    I created GitHub repo to share progress / notes  

**III. Chip-8 processor**  
    1. Load a ROM  
    2. Registers  
    3. Loop execution  
    4. Decode Opcodes  
    5. Implement each opcode  

**IV. User Input**  

**V. Troubleshoot**  

**VI. Display Output**  

**VII. Improvements** 
    1. Subdivide into functions
    2. Other clean-up


# To Do  
**VIII. Optimize**  
    It is running very slow (problem seems to be in draw())
    CPU usage is also very high

**IX. Sound Output**  

# Notes  
Example of how to format a link: [link](https://www.example.com).  
To make each line appear on a new line, make sure to end each line with two spaces.
